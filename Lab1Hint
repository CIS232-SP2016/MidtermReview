Use File/Scanner to access the text file. This file is not binary.
Use StringTokenizer to split the file. You will need to set the delimiter to ",".
Use the wrapper classes (Integer, Double) to parse the values.

Using an array is not necessary here, you can just keep track of the necessary values using accumulators/variables.
